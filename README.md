### About me :

    Hi, I'm Alex, a results-driven front-end developer with over a year of experience. Based in Kyiv, I
    specialize in crafting visually stunning, responsive websites that deliver exceptional user
    experiences. I have developed a number of websites for my portfolio, covering various industries. And
    this number continues to grow steadily.
    Let's collaborate to bring your vision to life.


    I'm passionate about transforming my creativity and knowledge into successful websites. I've helped
    various clients establish their online presence and stay ahead of the curve by keeping up with the
    latesttechnologies and frameworks.


    I began my journey into web development and IT in December 2022. Initially, I learned from free
    YouTube tutorials, gradually diving deeper into the basics. In the spring of 2023, I purchased my
    first comprehensive JavaScript course. To further enhance my skills, I completed the 'High-Quality Web
    Interface Development' course taught by one of Ukraine's top instructors, Yevhen Andrikanych. After
    finishing the course in February 2024, I focused on creating my own portfolio, which I continue to
    develop today.
